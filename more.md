- Sometimes I use a fake name: Si-Xiao Lan（兰思晓）. In Chinese culture, 兰(orchid) represents noble character and is regarded as a symbol of a gentleman(君子) in Confucianism. 
思(Si) means "to think" and 晓（Xiao）means "to know" or sunrise, so together I wish that I can think and then get enlightened, 
like the sun goes out from the horizon and brings light to everything.

- I like learning languages. Besides my mother tongue Chinese and English, I know some French (enough to read EGA) and some (not so much) German. I can also read Arabic and Cyrillic letters.

  
- I like reading. My favorite book include: Fyodor Dostoevsky's _The Brothers Karamazov_, _The Idiot_,
Mikhail Sholokhov's _And Quiet Flows the Don_, Mario Vargas Llosa's _Conversation in The Cathedral_, Mikhail Bulgakov's _Master and Margarita_ and so on.
