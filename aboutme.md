## About me:

I am a master student learning mathematics in the University of Bonn, Germany. My interests include homotopy theory (more specifically, equivariant stable homotopy theory and chromatic homotopy theory) and number theory. Currently I'm doing my master thesis about equivariant homotopy theory under the supervision of Professor Stefan Schwede.

Before coming to Bonn, I finished my Bachelor study in the Sichuan University, China.
