## Funny:

Sometimes I use a fake name: Si-Xiao Lan（兰思晓）. In Chinese culture, 兰(orchid) represents noble character and is regarded as a symbol of a gentleman(君子). 
思(Si) means "to think" and 晓（Xiao） means "to know" or sunrise, so together I wish that I can think and then know, 
like the sun goes out from the horizon and brings light to everything.
